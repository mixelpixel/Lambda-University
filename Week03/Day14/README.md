- Brian Durbin's alternative solution:
> 1. You would fill the five quart jug via the three quart jug, then fill the three quart jug again to fill the last 2 quarts of the five quart jug - this would leave 1 quart in the 3 quart jug.
> 2. You then empty the 5 quart jug, and fill it with the remaing 1 quart in the 3 quart jug.
> 3. Fill the 3 quart jug again and pour it into the 5 quart jug.
> 4. This would give you exactly 4 quarts.
